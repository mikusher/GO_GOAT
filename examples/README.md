# These examples utilize the 'Most Popular' and 'Semantic' public APIs from The New York Times.
### To run the `servers` examples, you'll need to generate a set of API keys and embed them in the appropriate config files.
  1. If you haven't already, register for API keys by requesting a key here: http://developer.nytimes.com/signup
  3. Create a key for the "Most Popular API" and the "Semantic API" and add them to the proper 'config.json' and '.env' files.
